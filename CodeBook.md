Result tidy dataset named dataset_tidy contains the following variables:
1. Volunteer ID: identify the subject who partecipate to the event. It is a numerical id
2. Activity Description: describe the action executed by subject during the measurement
3 to 68: contains averages of mean and standard deviation for the following measures
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag

in which prefixes t and f mean:
t: measure collected in time domain
f: measure collected in frequency domain

suffix XYZ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions

other meanings:
Body: body acceleration
Gravity: gravity acceleration

Jerk: rate at which an object's acceleration changes with respect to time

Acc: accelerometer
Gyro: gyroscope

Mag: magnitude of three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm
